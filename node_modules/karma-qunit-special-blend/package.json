  "readme": "# Qunit-Special-Blend\n\nEver want to run a single qunit test from your test suite with karma?\nYeah, so did I.\n\nThis plugin/wrapper/npm module/hack was created to allow you to run a single\nqunit test or module with the karma test runner.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install karma-qunit-special-blend`\n\n## Usage\n\nAfter the package is installed configure your frameworks array in `karma.conf.js` as\nfollows:\n\n``` javascript\n  frameworks: ['qunit', 'qunit-sb'],\n```\n\nYou will now be able to use two new functions in your tests.js files\n`singleTest` and `singleModule` in addition to the regular qunit `test` and\n`module` methods.\n\nIf you don't have any of the new methods in your test files all tests will run\nas usual. If you have used the new methods only those tests will run.\n\n\n## Vim plugin to make this more convenient\n\nI don't want to change `test` to `singleTest` and back all the time in my test\nfiles file, because this is supposed to make things faster and easier after\nall. I also happen to use Vim so I have written the [vim-qunit-special-blend](https://github.com/JarrodCTaylor/vim-qunit-special-blend)\nplugin that leverages the functionality provided by this npm module to run\nsingle tests but allows you to do it without altering your test code.\n",
